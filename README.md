Code for TR estimates.

Highly automated, this set of scripts downloads, assembles macroeconomic time series on the US economy and then uses the tidy dataset to estimate a number of TR specifications through simple OLS with stability checks, Markov Switching Models (two or three states), VAR and SVAR. Results are stored and output in rule-specific text files, alongside with all plots produced. In addition, the composed dataset is stored in a proper CSV file with xts time series features, for later use. 



### Todo list:
